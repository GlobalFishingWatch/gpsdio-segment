## 3.0.0 - 2022-07-15

### Added

  add even more additional sorting to stabilize remove stale segments

  add additional sorting to stabilize remove stale segments

  simplify checks for bad message

  fix tests now that we are relying on input being sanitized of bad values

  better null checks

  check using is_null not is None

  switch checks to take into acount Andres's fixes to the segmenter that convert invalid values to None

  now that bad courses become nans correctly handle them

  [PR#85](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/gpsdio-segment/pull/85): Improve seg id generation so we don't get occasional duplicate seg ids.
  Changes the segmenter identity matching logic [PR#73](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/gpsdio-segment/pull/73)
    This changes the identity matching window to 15 minutes, since 6 minutes
    is too low for the data quality we have on 2012. It also removes the
    receiver from the identity cache keys, because that field is causing a
    lot of problems due to hard inconsistencies.
  Updates the version in the __init__.py
  add basic tests for current identity assignment [PR#74](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/gpsdio-segment/pull/74)
  move identity  addition so it works forward and backwards; adjust tests [PR#74](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/gpsdio-segment/pull/74)
  Adds version update information
  Adds changelog information for the last 2 releases
  run through black, isort, and flak8
  start adding comments about where we should refactor
  first pass of refactor; break up process in small functions; py.test passes and flake8 happy
  break out matching code to separate class
  break out msg processing code into separate class
  fix imports with isort
  Removed class inheritance on Segmentizer as it no longer needs DiscrepancyCalculator functions. The only one is uses is a static method so it is now called directly from the class rather than from self. [PR#77](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/gpsdio-segment/pull/77)
  Updated a few loop yields to use  instead for cleaner code
  Changed one last yield for loop to a
  Added docstrings to all internal functions. Renamed `_clean` to `_clean_segment` for more clarity.
  Added docstrings to DiscrepancyCalculator class. Change one function to be denoted internal with underscore.
  Some flake8 cleanup
  Finished docstrings
  Changed Segmentizer to Segmenter and placed in segmenter.py to maintain consistency. core.py is kept with pass-through import and Segmentizer class.
  Ran pre-commit on all files for linting/styling
  add new regression tests
  Updated the path to the repo in the README.rst
  Changed query that pulls expected tracks for regression testing to be deterministic by adding msgid to sort criteria. Update .pre-commit-config.yaml because there were so many conflicts to reorder checks because isort and flake8 were colliding.
  Modified the gitignore for .ipynb_checkpoints/
  Fixed a bug in test_edge_cases where test messages were not given types and pytest was passing on the wrong type of ValueError. Modified to add type to messages and explicitly check that ValueError message mentioned 'unsorted'
  Added new unit tests aimed at msg_processor.py. Fixed a bug and duplicate code in msg_processor.py. Moved a test from test_edge_cases.py to test_msg_processor.py since it was more relevant there.
  Added a readme to gpsdio_segment/ with diagram for how a message moves through the segmenter.
  Added unit test for last BAD_MESSAGE test.
  Removed SAFE_SPEED check and updated unit tests to reflect
  Added link between the two READMEs
  Update README.rst
  allow newish builting timezone objects
  Atomic identities ([PR#78](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/gpsdio-segment/pull/78))
  switch to atomic identities
  fix identity storage
  another identity fix
  still trying to get something for identities that will work well pipe-segment
  add destintions; clean out unused code
  make destination have tuple type similar to identity
  add some debug logging to track down where all my data went
  add more debug logging to track down where all my data went
  turn down logging
  refactor to allow pipe-segment to use metrics
  bump default hours to 24
  protect against negative hours
  fix all fast tests; comment out identity tests since they need to be redone
  Updated identity unit tests to reflect new atomic identities. ([PR#81](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/gpsdio-segment/pull/81))

  Updated regression tests to reflect atomic identities [PR#82](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/gpsdio-segment/pull/82). Some segmenter changes made segments span over more days, changing the expected seg_id for many messages. Some SSVID regression tests were automatically deleted as they did not have data in 2021010* as at some point these files had been created for the larger time range of 202101*. Biggest change is converting new namedtuples for Identity and Destination into JSON serializable objects in test_expected.add_expected().
  fix for [Issue#83](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/gpsdio-segment/issues/83)-[PR#84](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/gpsdio-segment/pull/84) test_unsorted transient failure
  untested implementation of new way to generate ids

## 0.20.2 - 2020-10-13

### Fixes

* [PIPELINE-144](https://globalfishingwatch.atlassian.net/browse/PIPELINE-144):
  Fixes the identity assignment logic so that identity messages appearing after
  a batch of positional messages are not discarded.

## 0.20.1 - 2020-10-06

### Changes

* [PIPELINE-139](https://globalfishingwatch.atlassian.net/browse/PIPELINE-139):
  Removes the receiver from the identity cache because that field is completely
  broken.

## 0.20 - 2020-04-07

### Added

* [GlobalFishingWatch/gfw-eng-tasks#47](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/gfw-eng-tasks/issues/47): Adds
    guard code over `course` field when has None value when normalize message.

## 0.19

### Changes

* Change to a metric based primarily on "discrepancy" which is how far the vessel is from where we expect it to be based on its course and speed.
* What we mean by expect is informed by the experiments in extracting probability clouds for AIS matching.
* Many heuristics are applied based on extensive experimentation, but more experimentation would still be helpful.

## 0.18

### Changes

* [GlobalFishingWatch/GFW-Tasks#1015](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/GFW-Tasks/issues/1015)
  * Remove checks for name/callsign when assigning segments.
  * Never check for transceiver type.
  * Add type 3 messages to class A message types.

## 0.17

### Changes
* Fix version of pyproj to avoid going to 2.X

## 0.16

### ADDED
* [#61](https://github.com/SkyTruth/gpsdio-segment/issues/61)
  Prefer segments with matching shipname and/or callsign
* [#63](https://github.com/SkyTruth/gpsdio-segment/issues/63)
  Treat a duplicate timestamp that is within noise distance from an existing segment as noise
* [#66](https://github.com/SkyTruth/gpsdio-segment/issues/66)
  When no shipname or callsign matches, prefer the segment with the most recent position

## 0.12
* [#60](https://github.com/SkyTruth/gpsdio-segment/pull/60) 
  Prefer segments with the same message type


## 0.11 - (2017-12-31)

* ['#54'](https://github.com/SkyTruth/gpsdio-segment/pull/54)
  Ignore noise segments in Segmentizer.from_seg_states()

* ['#56'](https://github.com/SkyTruth/gpsdio-segment/pull/56)
  Performance improvement for the special case where all messages added to a segment are 
  non-positional (have no lat/lon as is the case with type 5 AIS messages)

## 0.10 - (2017-12-22)

* ['#50'](https://github.com/SkyTruth/gpsdio-segment/pull/50)
  Emit noise messages in a new segment class `NoiseSegment` that works like 
  `BadSegment`

* ['#49'](https://github.com/SkyTruth/gpsdio-segment/pull/49)
  New option `collect_match_stats` for Segmentizer that captures all the stats used to 
  determine which segment a message is added to.  The stats are added to the message in 
  a field called `segment_matches`
